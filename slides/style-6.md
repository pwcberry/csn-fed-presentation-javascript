## No block scope

JavaScript only has functional and global scope. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Variable definitions are hoisted to the top of the function. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

How can you work with "for" loops and event-handler assignment? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
